### Architectural Patterns

The platform follows several modern architectural patterns and practices:

1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
   - Rich domain model with aggregates (Account, Cocktail, Ingredient)
   - Domain events for cross-aggregate communication
   - Value objects and entities with encapsulated business logic
   - Ubiquitous language reflected in code structure

2. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
   - Commands for state-changing operations
   - Queries for read-only operations
   - MediatR for command/query handling
   - Separate command and query models

3. **Repository Pattern**
   - Generic repository interfaces
   - Cosmos DB implementation
   - Unit of Work pattern for transaction management
   - Caching strategies for frequently accessed data

4. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Domain events for internal communication
   - Integration events for cross-service communication
   - Dapr pub/sub for event distribution via Azure Service Bus
   - Event handlers for side effects

5. **Dependency Injection**
   - Constructor injection throughout the codebase
   - Interface-based design
   - Service registration in startup
   - Scoped lifetime management

6. **Clean Architecture**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Domain layer independence
   - Infrastructure layer for external concerns
   - Application layer for use cases

7. **Validation and Error Handling**
   - FluentValidation for command validation
   - Custom exception types
   - Global error handling
   - Validation pipeline behavior

### Microservices Architecture
The platform is built using a microservices architecture with the following components:

1. **Cocktails API**
   - RESTful API service
   - Business logic and data access
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Event-driven messaging with Dapr and Azure Service Bus
   - Cosmos DB integration

2. **Cocktails Frontend**
   - Single Page Application (SPA)
   - Material-UI components
   - MSAL authentication
   - Responsive design
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities

3. **Supporting Services**
   - Email service (Zoho SMTP)
   - Image processing and storage
   - User avatar management
   - Rating system

### Infrastructure Components

1. **Data Layer**
   - Azure Cosmos DB for data storage
   - Azure Blob Storage for images
   - Dapr state management

2. **Security Layer**
   - Azure B2C for authentication
   - Key Vault for secrets management
   - SSL/TLS encryption
   - DDoS protection via Front Door

3. **Messaging Layer**
   - Dapr pub/sub via Azure Service Bus
   - Azure Service Bus
   - Event-driven architecture

4. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Application Insights
   - OpenTelemetry integration
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error tracking

## üöÄ Deployment Architecture

The platform follows a multi-environment deployment strategy:

1. **Development**: For active development and testing
2. **Staging**: Pre-production environment
3. **Production**: Live environment with high availability

Each environment is provisioned using Terraform and follows infrastructure-as-code principles.
